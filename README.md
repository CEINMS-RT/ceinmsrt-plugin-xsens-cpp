# Xsens Plugin

Plugin to receive kinematics data from the Xsens software and sensors. Optionally, you can also use it with TwinCAT (throught [ADS](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-ca/products/automation/twincat/tc1xxx-twincat-3-base/tc1000.html)) to combine data or send command to a robotics device using TwinCAT. This can be activated by using the CMake option ``USE_TWINCAT`` in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt#L9).

## Installation

### Xsens

* Install Xsens MVN Analyze (Tested version: 2020.0) [here](https://www.xsens.com/software-downloads?hsCtaTracking=62e6fd16-1936-4f65-9660-f85c413320da%7C3912eea5-ec35-43d9-b6fb-e2d1be46ee71), including its Developer Toolkit (under the 'Tools' tab, tested version: 1.0.7)
* Put path to Xsens MVN Developer Toolkit in PATH environment variables
* Compile the CEINMS

### TwinCAT

See [here](CMakeLists.txt).

## Getting Started

### Plugin available

#### Consumer and producer plugin

``` xml
PluginPositionAndTorqueTwinCatAndXsens
```

Get ankle left and right data from TwinCAT. In fact this plugin does not use Xsens. Send joint torque data to TwinCAT.

``` xml
PluginPositionAndTorqueTwinCatAndXsensCalib
```

Get lower-limb kinematics data from Xsens. Send joint torque data to TwinCAT.

#### Angle only plugin

``` xml
PluginXsensAngle
```

Get lower-limb and upper-limb kinematics data from Xsens.

``` xml
PluginXsensAngleLowerLimb
```

Get upper-limb kinematics data from Xsens.

``` xml
PluginXsensAngleUpperLimb 
```

Get lower-limb kinematics data from Xsens.

### Connection to Xsens

* Open Xsens MVN software
* Click the Network Streamer for options and make sure that 1 stream is selected with port 9763, protocol UDP, stream rate max. In the datagram below select only "Joint Angles".
* Optionally, if you want to replay a saved xsens data file, click "File -> Open" to open a file from example data
* Run CEINMS (with PluginXsens as angle device)
* If recording in CEINMS (-r option) is enabled, the output folder will contain a file named "ikXsens" with the joint angles if using the twincat plugin otherwise it is save as the ik.sto.

### Connection to TwinCAT

The inputs and outputs are composed of vector in ADS with the following name:

"NMS_Controller.Input.CEINMS_In" (data going to TwinCAT)

"NMS_Controller.Output.CEINMS_Out" (data going from TwinCAT)

The name of the task in TwinCAT is TcCOM object. The name of the variables is ``CEINMS_In`` for the input from CEINMS to TwinCAT and ``CEINMS_Out`` for the output from TwinCAT to CEINMS.
If your TwinCAT project does not follow this convention CEINMS will not connect and transmit the data.
This name can be found [here](src/PluginPositionAndTorqueTwinCatAndXsens.cpp#L26).
The ``CEINMS_In`` is composed of the following data (LREAL) ([see](src/PluginPositionAndTorqueTwinCatAndXsens.cpp#L67)):

* Left Ankle Position
* Right Ankle Position
* Left Ankle Torque (from the exo)
* Right Ankle Torque (from the exo)
* Random Signal
* Trigger

The ``CEINMS_Out`` is composed of the following data (LREAL) ([see](src/PluginPositionAndTorqueTwinCatAndXsens.cpp#L195)):

* Left Ankle Torque (NMS)
* Right Ankle Torque (NMS)
